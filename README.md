# Seoul Bike Trip Duration Prediction


Welcome to the Seoul Bike Trip Duration Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the duration of bike trips in Seoul, South Korea. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a bike-sharing enthusiast, or simply curious about predicting bike trip durations, this project has something for you.

## Project Overview

Bike-sharing programs have gained popularity in cities worldwide, offering a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. Understanding and predicting trip durations can be valuable for bike-sharing operators, urban planners, and even individual riders. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the duration of bike trips in Seoul.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a rich dataset obtained from the Seoul Bike Sharing System, which contains historical information about bike rentals, weather conditions, and other relevant features. The dataset has been carefully preprocessed and cleaned to ensure its usability. You can access the dataset [here](dataset_link).

## Installation

To get started with the Seoul Bike Trip Duration Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tushar2704/Seoul-bike-trip-duration.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Seoul_Bike_Trip_Duration_Prediction.ipynb` notebook and explore the project.

## Model Training and Evaluation

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find detailed code and explanations for the entire machine learning pipeline. This includes data exploration and visualization, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and prediction analysis. We have provided various models for you to experiment with, such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

## Results and Performance Metrics

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The model with the best performance on the test set will be used for predicting bike trip durations.
